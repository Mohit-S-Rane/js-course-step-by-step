# Step-By-Step-JS Project
Welcome to the learning oriented project! This README file serves as a guide to understand the project structure, setup instructions, and other essential information.

## Project Overview
My objective for this project is to learn JavaScript through the utilization of a Git repository. Recently, I came across an excellent JavaScript course, and to aid in your day-to-day tasks, I have created a Git repository that will be beneficial for learning and practicing JavaScript. If you're interested in learning from this project, you can simply review the commits in sequential order, which will provide a learning progression.

## Technologies Used
In this project, our primary focus is to understand the fundamental concepts using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
